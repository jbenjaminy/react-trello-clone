"react-trello" is a single page application for task/project management developed using the React JavaScript library. While the library, framework, and design choices are usually invisible to the end-user, under the hood, this application is made up of various modular components that communicate with each other, are customizable, reusable, and therefore more maintainable. What does matter to the end-user is that React-driven applications (e.g., react-trello) run very fast.

To launch the application, make sure all application dependencies are installed, run the build system, and start the server. Once the application is running on the server, you can access react-trello at the URL or the host running the application.

From the command line, issue the following commands:

1. $ npm install
2. $ npm run build
3. $ npm run serve

By default, the application is listening on port 8080 on the local host.

Access the application at http://localhost:8080
